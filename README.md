# Customer Reference Management System

• Worked on my senior year project under an architect from SAP to create a Saas tool that manages customer testimonials.
• Designed and developed the user interface and dashboard using Angular 6 and ChartsJs.
• Built microservices, data models, and implemented RESTful APIs using ExpressJs, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
• Wrote unit tests and integration tests using Mocha, Chai, and performed end to end testing using Selenium.
• Created a CI/CD using Jenkins, Git, and deployed the app in SAP Cloud PaaS.
