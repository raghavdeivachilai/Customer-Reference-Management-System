# CustomerReference
Customer references are valuable testimonials that can aid in sharing success stories and positive experiences of using Customer products and services with potential new customers.  A customer reference program can help support the following use cases:
● Sales representatives identify a suitable customer reference to assist with their selling efforts.
● Faster customer reference fulfillment time enables a reduction in the sales cycles.
● Marketing, Sales, Analyst Relations, Prod Ops, Executive Management need to find success stories to share with analysts, the press, customers, prospects, speak with the media, at events, and other use cases. (See org and use case matrix in section 2.1)
● Determine gaps in customer references for certain industries/products/geographies. 
● Monitor reference usage to avoid overusing and under using valuable customer references.
