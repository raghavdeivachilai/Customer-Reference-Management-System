# Customer Reference Management System

I developed a B2B platform for using Customer References as valuable testimonials to help the sales team to assist with their selling efforts. 
* I designed and developed  the systemâ€™s user interface using Angular,HTML, CSS  and Bootstrap and TypeScript.
* I implemented REST API calls in Express.js using JavaScript and created the Collections and the Documents in MongoDB using Mongoose.
* I also analyzed the sales data and created a visualization service using Charts.js to help the sales team understand trends and make decisions.
* Finally, I successfully deployed the Application in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
